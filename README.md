This is an employee contact info app created with the help of Java Guides on YouTube.

It was created with React, Bootstrap, Maven, and Axios on the frontend. On the backend, it was created using Springboot with Eclipse, and the database is handled with MySQLWorkbench.

The user will be able to view employee information in a list, view individual employees' information separately, and add, edit, and delete information as they see fit.
